FOREWORD
This Standard is primarily concerned with providing measures to reduce the risks of
undetected subterranean termite attack on buildings. Improving the design and construction
of buildings to minimize termite damage is one of several risk reduction measures available
to building owners and occupiers.
This Standard describes measures to deter termite attack arising from concealed entry into a
building. The system options provided rely on a combination of partial measures to termite
passage combined with perimeter inspection zones so that when termites attack, evidence of
their workings is in the open where it may be detected more readily during regular
inspections. The measures contained in this Standard cannot guarantee that a building will
never be entered by termites nor will ever suffer some form of termite attack.
The requirements for an effective termite management system depend on design, location,
site conditions and building characteristics.
More than 350 species of termites have been recorded in Australia, about 30 of which
achieve economic importance as pests of timber—in-service. With the exception of drywood
termites, all species of economic importance are soil dwelling (subterranean) and have
similar habits.
Subterranean termites may eat timber and timber products, plant fibre, or any material
containing cellulose (their principal food); this could include building contents, e.g.
cabinetry, furniture, books and papers, fabrics, clothing, footwear, packing cases and tools.
Termites can also damage some non-cellulose materials, e.g. mortar, soft metals, soft
plastics such as cable insulation, building sealants and rigid foam insulation.
Typically, termites form their nests in the soil, near ground level in a stump, in the trunk of
a living tree or other suitably large pieces of wood. Sometimes the nest takes the form of a
conical or dome-shaped mound. A colony may exist for many years and, as it matures, can
have a population well in excess of one million termites. Attack by subterranean termites
originates from the nest. Wood or timber lying on or buried in the ground may be reached
by underground foraging galleries but attack may occur well above ground level, either
inside the wood or by way of mud-walled shelter-tubes ‘plastered’ to exposed surfaces.
Timber resting on an impenetrable substructure may be reached by means of these shelter
tubes or through independent, freestanding columns built by the termites. In some cases,
where a source of permanent moisture, e.g. leaking plumbing, is available to subterranean
termites within a building, they can form a nest inside the building, without soil contact.
Where such a colony arises within a building, it may be several years before the termites
are sufficiently numerous to be detected.
‘Drywood termites’ are economically important only in restricted coastal, tropical,
subtropical and adjacent tableland areas of Australia. This Standard does not cover
measures to manage the risk of drywood termite attacks. Unlike subterranean termites they
do not construct galleries or tunnels connecting the infested timber with the soil, but form
their nest inside the wood upon which they feed and so may attack any piece of susceptible
timber, regardless of its position in a building. The evidence of infestation by these species
is the presence of dry, granular faecal pellets that may be stored in disused galleries or
ejected through small openings in the surface of the wood.

STANDARDS AUSTRALIA
Australian Standard
Termite management

Part 1: New building work

SECTION 1 SCOPE AND APPLICATION
1.1 SCOPE
This Standard sets out requirements for the design and construction of subterranean termite
management systems for new buildings and new building work. It includes solutions for
both physical and chemical termite management systems. Options are provided so that
various approaches may be used either singly, or in combination, to provide an integrated
termite management system.
This Standard includes methods to deter concealed entry by termites from the soil to the
building above the termite management system inspection zone.
This Standard does not cover procedures or details on maintenance and inspection.
This Standard does not apply to the following:
(a)
(b)
(C)

The provision of termite management systems to existing buildings (see Note 3).
Drywood termite infestations, as the systems described herein will not be effective
against access by drywood termites or termite nests established without soil contact.
Durability, maintenance and inspection procedures or details.
NOTES:

© Standards Australia

The treatment of existing buildings is covered in AS 3660.2. For the interface between new
and existing structures, see Paragraph Al, Appendix A.
For testing of systems and materials, refer to AS 3660.3.
A termite management system constructed in accordance with this Standard cannot prevent
termite attack as systems may be bridged or breached. Termite-bridged or termite-breached
systems may be detected during inspections.
The diagrams used in this Standard are indicative only and are deemed to meet the design
requirements outlined in Section 2. The diagrams apply to domestic construction techniques.
Some diagrams may have construction details (e.g. damp-proof courses, vapour barriers, and
the like) omitted for clarity.
Issues such as the detection of termite infestation, and the necessity and accessibility for
regular, competent inspections can be found in AS 3660.2. It is recommended that access for
inspection, maintenance and durability issues be considered part of the design process.
It is stressed that the installation of a termite management system does not negate the need for
regular competent inspections after installation.
Activities such as turﬁng, paving and landscaping adjacent to the building might compromise
the inspection zone clearances required by this Standard. Where it is known that these
activities will be undertaken, the design should ensure that sufficient dimensions are provided
so that the required minimum inspection zones are not compromised.
Where construction is at or close to the property boundary, it may not be possible to apply the
solutions of this Standard. See Paragraph A2, Appendix A.
Termite management systems may not be effective where a nest is established inside the
building above inspection zones. Such nests typically require signiﬁcant plumbing or
drainage faults for their water supply.

SECTION 2 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
2.1 SCOPE OF SECTION
This Section sets out the design requirements for termite management systems for new
building work.

2.2 ATTACHMENTS AND ITEMS ADJACENT TO BUILDINGS
Attachments to buildings such as downpipes and service pipes shall have a nominal gap, to
allow clear and uninterrupted visual inspection across the inspection zone.
Attachments and items adjacent to buildings such as steps, verandas, porches, access ramps,
carports, trellises, decks, hot-water systems, air conditioners, downpipes, service pipes, or
similar attachments, shall be separated from the building by a gap of at least 25 mm, to
allow clear and uninterrupted visual inspection across the inspection zone.
NOTE: Sufﬁcient clearance and access should be provided between any building and adjacent
items to allow for inspection and maintenance.
Where attachments or structures abut a building and there is no clear gap, the system shall
be provided or extended to the attachment so that a continuous inspection zone is preserved.
Where a plate or grid is used to cover the gap (e.g. for providing wheelchair access),
it shall be detachable.

2.3 ELEMENTS THAT BRIDGE OR BREACH TERMITE MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS
Structures, fixtures or ﬁttings attached to a building shall not bridge or breach a termite
management system unless that attachment is also provided with a termite management
system.

2.4 POTENTIAL ENTRY POINTS FOR TERMITES
Where a suspended ﬂoor has less than a 400 mm clearance, an underﬂoor termite
management system shall be installed to the whole of the underﬂoor area of reduced
clearance except as permitted by Clause 3.3.2(b).
NOTES:
1 Where a ﬂoor is suspended, areas too low for easy access [less than 400 mm clearance,
see Figure 3.1(A)] that have reduced airﬂow are favourable to termite activity and termites
may build shelter tubes between the ground and bearers. These, and a selection of other
vulnerable points, are depicted in Figure 2.1.
2 Certain parts of buildings are at higher risk than other parts of being exploited by termites to
gain concealed access. Cavities or discontinuities at or below exterior ground level are readily
exploited by termites. With slab-on-ground construction these vulnerable points may include
discontinuities in the slab (e.g. at joints and service penetrations) and mortar joints (in the
lower courses of perimeter brick walls). Termite management systems need to be provided at
these vulnerable points. For any particular building, the number and location of vulnerable
areas will depend on the type of construction used.

SECTION 3 REQUIREMENTS—GENERAL
3.1 SCOPE OF SECTION
This Section sets out requirements that meet the design criteria of Section 2 for speciﬁc
termite management systems. It speciﬁes the procedures to be implemented before, and in
association with, any building practices and installation of physical or chemical termite
management systems including those covered in Sections 4 to 7.
NOTES:
1 Advice for certiﬁcation of installed termite management systems is given in Paragraph A3,
Appendix A.
2 A listing of subterranean termites known to damage structures is given in Appendix B.

3.2 STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS BELOW TERMITE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
All structural elements below the termite management system or any penetration through a
structural element or in contact with the ground shall be termite resistant.
NOTE: Common penetrations of structural elements include pipes, conduits, pins and wires.
The following materials shall be deemed to be termite resistant:
(a) Masonry—fired clay and concrete bricks, concrete blocks and stone.
NOTE: Termites may gain entry through mortar and other joints.
(b) Concrete elements—complying with AS 2870 or AS 3600.
(c) Timber—complying with the following:
(i) Naturally termite-resistant timbers listed in Appendix C.
NOTE: When considering using timbers listed in AppendixC for use in ground
contact, appropriate reference should be made to AS 5604. Reference was made to
AS (AS/NZS) 1604 (series), AS 1720.2 and AS/NZS 1148 in compiling the list of
termite-resistant timbers given in Paragraph C5, Appendix C.
(ii) Preservative-treated timbers in accordance with AS (AS/NZS) 1604 (series) and
speciﬁed for the appropriate hazard level in accordance with Appendix D.
NOTE: Where preservative-treated timbers are cut, notched, or planed, the affected
surface should be treated with a suitable remedial preservative.
((1) Steel, aluminium or other metals.
(e) Fibre-reinforced cement.
(f) Unplastz‘cized polyvinyl chloride (PVC)—having a minimum thickness of 1 mm and a
minimum hardness Shore D 80 (instantaneous).
NOTE: The use of termite-resistant materials in contact with the ground does not in itself form a
termite management system. Termite-resistant materials may provide termites with concealed
access to other parts of the building.

3.3 REQUIREMENTS FOR SUSPENDED FLOORS
3.3.1 General
This Clause (3.3) sets out requirements for buildings with suspended ﬂoors, where the
termite management system needs to be inspected or replenished.

www.standards.org.au © Standards Australia


Accessed by Ventura Homes on 03 Apr 2017 (Document currency not guaranteed when printed)

AS 3660.1:2014 14

3.3.2 Access for visual inspection
The following apply:
(a) A minimum clearance of 400 mm between ﬁnished ground level and any structural
components or other obstructions (e.g. bearers, joists, plumbing ﬁxtures or ducting
systems).
(b) The minimum clearance in Item (a) may be reduced to 150 mm at the inside face of
an external wall, provided clearance from the ﬁnished ground level slopes to 400 mm
within a horizontal distance not more than 2 m from the reduced clearance. Where the
reduced clearance is applied, it shall be ensured that access for Visual maintenance is
maintained throughout the entire suspended ﬂoor.
NOTES:
1 For details, see Figure 3.1(A).
2 The risk of undetected termite access is signiﬁcantly increased where the clearance for
inspection is reduced below 400 mm.
3.3.3 Clearance from masonry components
No portion of timber subﬂoor members, including bearers, joists or bottom plates, shall be
closer than 25 mm to any vertical external masonry wall surface.
NOTE: For details, see Figure 3.1(B).
3.3.4 Isolated piers, posts and stumps
Access for inspection shall be available to all isolated piers, posts and stumps, which shall
be covered with termite sheet material complying with Section 5. Termite sheet material
requirements shall not apply where posts, piers and stumps comply with the following
criteria:
(a) A vertical inspection zone of at least 75 mm is provided, and—
(i) where concrete stumps or drawn or welded metal tubular piers are used,
provided the piers are free from perforations, they are sealed at the top and
access for inspection of the full perimeter of the pier or stump is available;
(ii) where prefabricated metal piers are tightly ﬁtted to any ﬂange that complies
with Clause 5.2 such that no gap exceeds 0.4 mm or, where any gap exceeds
0.4 mm, they are joined as speciﬁed in Clause 5.3.11 and access for inspection
of the full perimeter of the pier or stump is available; or
NOTE: For details, see Figure 3.1(C).
(iii) where timber posts are installed without ground contact, metal stirrups that
have a continuous base are used to prevent termites passing through the base of
the stirrup.
NOTE: For details, see Figure 3.1(D).
(b) Where timber posts and stumps installed in ground contact are used, they shall be
preservative treated to minimum H5 in accordance with AS (AS/NZS) 1604 (series)
or shall be of naturally termite-resistant timber (see Appendix C) and have sheet
material installed to create an inspection zone.
NOTE: Posts and piers may contain or develop cracks and defects that permit concealed
termite access. Installation of sheet material is used to create an inspection zone.
3.3.5 Drainage
The ground beneath suspended ﬂoors and the external ﬁnished surface surrounding the
external walls of the building shall be drained in accordance with the requirements of the
National Construction Code (NCC). The subﬂoor area below a suspended ﬂoor shall be
graded and drained to prevent ponding of water under the building. All exterior paving and
other ground surfaces abutting external walls shall be graded to prevent water ponding
against the building.

SECTION 4 REQUIREMENTS—CONCRETE
SLABS

4.1 GENERAL
This Section sets out requirements for concrete slabs to be used as a component of a termite
management system to deter termites from gaining concealed access to a building.

4.2 CONCRETE SLABS
In addition to the requirements of Clause 2.2, a concrete slab or footing forming part of a
termite management system shall—
(a) have all interfaces between the penetrations and slab or footing provided with a
termite management system integrated with the slab; and
(b) have all joints, except for tied footing slab construction joints [see Figure 4.l(c)],
provided with a termite management system integrated with the slab.

4.3 SLAB-ON-GROUND
4.3.1 General
A slab-on-ground shall be designed and constructed in accordance with AS 2870 or
AS 3600. All joints and penetrations shall comply with Clause 4.3.2, and the edge shall be
exposed in accordance with Clause 4.4 or have a termite management system installed in
accordance with Sections 5, 6 or 7.
NOTES:
1 Compacting and curing the concrete will enhance the performance of the slab both
structurally and in its ability to resist penetration by termites. Thoroughly compacting
concrete ensures that maximum density and strength is achieved by eliminating voids. It also
provides clean, sharp edges and maximum bond to the reinforcement. For edge beams and
footings and in locations where a smooth slab edge is required, compaction is recommended.
2 Curing ensures that the concrete will achieve its potential strength and reduce the likelihood
of shrinkage and cracking. Curing is the retention of moisture in the concrete to allow
hydration of the cement.
3 If constructed in accordance with AS 3600, due regard should be given to minimizing
shrinkage and cracking.
Any penetrations through concrete slabs from temporary ﬁxings, to support items such as
formwork, shall be cleared and filled prior to the final setting of the concrete using either—
(a) a concrete of the same strength and properties; or
(b) a non-shrink grout of minimum strength greater than that of the concrete.
After ﬁnal setting, any penetrations shall be ﬁlled using only a non-shrink grout equal in
strength to that of the concrete.
4.3.2 Joints and penetrations
4.3.2.1 Vertical construction joints
Vertical construction joints, regardless of whether the reinforcement is continuous through
the joint or not, shall have a termite management system installed in accordance with
Sections 5, 6 or 7.

AS 3660.1:2014 18

4.3.2.2 Footing slab construction joints
Where edge beams, stiffening beams, footing beams and retaining walls form part of the
slab construction, and—
(a) they are placed as an integral component of the slab, or tied together in accordance
with AS 2870;
(b) the surface of the footing is cleaned prior to placing the slab; and
(c) the concrete is compacted to eliminate voids at the joint,
termite treatment of the joint is not required.
NOTE: Examples of footing systems not requiring joint treatment are depicted in Figure 4.1.
In all other cases, joints at the junction/support of the slab and the horizontal joint shall
have termite management systems installed in accordance with Sections 6, 7 or 8.
NOTE: Examples of footing systems requiring joint treatment are depicted in Figure 4.2.

4.3.2.3 Isolation, sawn or other movement controljoints
Where isolation, sawn or other movement control joints occur in the slab, they shall have a
termite management system installed in accordance with Sections 5, 6 or 7.
4.3.2.4 Penetrations
4.3.2.4.1 General
Penetrations through slabs such as service pipes shall be termite resistant and shall have a
termite management system installed, or shall function as a termite management system.
A termite management system ﬁtted to penetrations shall be—
(a) as speciﬁed in Sections 5, 6 or 7; or
(b) a collar.
Additionally, service pipes set into the cavity adjacent to infill slabs shall have a termite
management system installed in accordance with Sections 5, 6 or 7, integrated with the slab
or perimeter termite management system.
4.3.2.4.2 Penetration collars for use with concrete slabs
Collars shall be embedded into the concrete or adhered to the surface using a
termite-resistant adhesive or ﬁller in accordance with AS 3660.3. Collars shall comply with
the material requirements of one or more of Items (b) to (f) of Clause 5.2 or be of a
chemically treated product complying with AS 3660.3.
Where a collar is to be embedded in a concrete slab, it shall be placed so as to sit not less
than 40 mm from the upper surface and not closer than 50 mm to any reinforcing mesh or
bar chair.
NOTE: Galvanized steel is not suitable and certain products that comply with Items (d) and (e) of
Clause 5.2 may be prone to corrosion when in contact with the alkaline concrete. Collars placed
too high or too close to reinforcing steel or bar chairs may not achieve the required concrete
contact.

4.4 SLAB EDGE EXPOSURE
Where slab edge exposure is used as part of a termite management system, the exposed face
of the perimeter of the slab shall be off-the-form and shall not exhibit areas of rough
surface, honeycombing or ripples. The slab edge shall be exposed for a minimum of 75 mm
above ﬁnished ground, landscaping or paving level to permit ready detection of termite
entry and shall not be rendered, tiled, clad, or concealed by vapour barrier, plastic sheeting,
ﬂashings, adjoining structures, paving, soil or other coating or cover that might provide
scope for concealed termite access.
NOTES:
1 For examples of slab edge exposure, see Figure 4.3.
2 The purpose of slab edge exposure is to provide an inspection zone for detection of termite
ingress.
3 Areas of rough surface, honeycombing or ripples caused by folds of vapour barriers can
conceal termite mud-tubes.

SECTION 5 REQUIREMENTS—SHEET
MATERIALS

5.1 GENERAL
This Section sets out the requirements for sheet materials used as a component of a termite
management system to deter termites from gaining concealed access to a building.
Sheets are applied to cover subfloor construction that may otherwise permit termites to gain
concealed entry.
This Section shall be read in conjunction with the requirements of Section 3.

5.2 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS
Termite caps and sheeting shall be manufactured from one or more of the following
materials:
(a) Galvanized steel, minimum thickness 0.5 mm (see Notesl to 4). Steel shall be
galvanized to AS/NZS 4680, and the coating class shall be at least 2275.
(b) Sheet copper, quarter hard, minimum thickness 0.4 mm (see Notes 1, 3 and 4).
(c) Stainless steel, half-hard, minimum thickness 0.4 mm (see Notes 1, 3 and 4).
(d) Aluminium alloy, minimum thickness 0.5 mm (see Notes 1, 3 and 4).
(e) Alloys of copper and zinc, minimum thickness 0.5 mm (see Notes 1, 3 and 4).
(f) Mesh, stainless steel minimum grade 316, with a minimum molybdenum content of
2.5% (see Notes 3 and 4). The mesh shall have an aperture size smaller than the head
width of the termite species in the area of use. The mesh shall be tested in accordance
with AS 3660.3.
NOTE: Recommend maximum aperture size is reduced for parts of Northern Australia Where
the very small species Heterotermes vagus may occur.
(g) PVC sheeting of Shore hardness D 80 (instantaneous), minimum thickness 1.0 mm.
(h) Chemically treated sheet tested in accordance with AS 3660.3 and registered with the
pesticides registrar.
Materials and dimensions not specified above shall be tested in accordance with AS 3660.3.
NOTES:
1 Zinc/aluminium alloy-coated steel and zinc-annealed steel are both unacceptable because they
can readily corrode.
2 The atmospheric conditions and the corrosive potential of some building materials, e.g. bricks
and mortar, should be considered when selecting the sheet material to be used. Coatings such
as bitumen or zinc chromate may be required in order to provide corrosion resistance for the
required service life.
3 The material selected for sheeting should not produce electrolytic corrosion when used in
contact with other components of the building, e.g. steel framing should not be in contact
with stainless steel.
4 The sizes given are ‘ﬁrst choice’ (R10), see AS 2338.

AS 3660.1:2014 22

5.3 INSTALLATION OF SHEETING
5.3.1 General
Where used, termite sheet materials shall be installed on all subﬂoor structures through or
on which termites might gain concealed access, such as piers, posts, stumps and walls,
below the underside of the lowest ﬂoor-framing member or suspended concrete slab. The
surfaces in contact with termite sheet materials shall be free from irregularities that could
damage the sheets.
5.3.2 External walls
Where used, the entire width of the external walls, including any cavities in the wall, shall
be sheeted to the outside wall face and the sheeting shall be continuously visible at the
exterior. When the external wall is rendered, the sheet shall be ﬁnished ﬂush with the
outside face of the render.
NOTE: For an example, see Figure 5.1(a).
5.3.3 Internal foundation walls
All internal foundation walls shall be covered with termite sheet materials. The sheet
materials on engaged piers shall be an extension of the wall sheeting. Where crawl space
accesses or ventilation openings have a height of less than 400 mm, sheeting shall be
continuous over the opening. Sheet material shall project on all sides so that no edge is less
than 40 mm from the vertical face of the pier and the edges are turned down at an angle
from the horizontal.
NOTES:
1 Typical examples of the above are depicted in Figures 5.1(b) and 5.1(c).
2 Where a sheet overhangs an edge, it may be necessary to provide support from beneath to
ensure the minimum 40 mm overhang is retained. Any such support should—
(a) be compatible with the sheet;
(b) not extend beyond the sheet; and
(c) not impede visual inspection.

(a) External substructure wall

5.3.4 Suspended ﬂoors
A sheet shall have a plane surface of size and shape to fully cover the top of the pier, post,
or the horizontal surface of the wall. The sheet shall project on all sides so that no edge
shall be less than 40 mm from the vertical face of the pier or wall when the edges are turned
down at an angle from the horizontal.
NOTE: For an example, see Figure 5.1.
Service pipes, ties and similar connections beneath suspended ﬂoors shall not be ﬁtted
closer than 25 mm from the edges of any sheet unless the sheet termite management system
is extended to include the service pipe or connection.
NOTE: For a typical treatment, see Figure 5.2.
The sheet ﬁtted to the top of a pier, post or other subﬂoor structure shall be able to be
visually inspected. Where access for inspection is restricted, the sheet shall be continuous
with adjoining termite management system components.

FIGURE 5.2 CLEARANCE BETWEEN SHEETING AND ANCHOR BOLTS
5.3.5 Under slab
Where a concrete slab is not to be termite resistant [see Clauses 3.2(b) and 4.3.1], it may be
fully underlain with sheet material. Under-slab sheeting shall be—
(a) placed so as to accommodate expected movements;
(b) integrated with management system components applied to pipes and penetrations and
any joints; and
(c) integrated continuously with the perimeter termite management system.
NOTE: Care should be exercised to ensure that the integrity of the sheet material is not impaired
by levelling pegs or formwork.
5.3.6 Concrete slab penetrations
Where sheeting is used on a slab-penetrating pipe or service, a collar, consisting of an
annular ﬂange of sheet material with a minimum annular width of 15 mm and minimum
height against the pipe or service of 20 mm, shall be cast into the concrete slab or, where it
is to be concealed beneath a permanent ﬁxture, it shall be sealed to the top surface of the
slab with a termite-resistant adhesive tested in accordance with AS 3660.3.
Attachment to the pipe or service shall be such that no gap is in excess of 0.4 mm. Where a
ﬂange to be cast into a concrete slab is clamped or tied to retain position on the pipe or
service, the clamp or tie shall be above the horizontal annulus.
NOTES:
1 For typical details of collar cast into concrete slab, see Figure 5.3, Options B and C.
2 Consideration should be given to the spacing of adjacent pipes or services to allow sufﬁcient
space for the installation of sheet to each such pipe or service.
3 An upper surface sheet ﬂange may be protected from incidental damage if it is embedded in
the mortar bed of tiled ﬂoor ﬁnishes, or concealed under false ﬂoors of kitchen cupboards or
bathroom vanities.

5.3.7 Concrete slab joints
Where there is a discontinuity in the slab such as a key joint or where separate slabs align,
any sheet material shall be placed so as to accommodate the expected movement or, if not
speciﬁed, shall be placed so as to accommodate a horizontal movement of not less than
15 mm with not less than 35 mm contact with any slab face.
NOTES:
1 This change allows other than 35 mm where specified.
2 For example, this may be achieved with a strip of stainless steel mesh with a 15 mm wide
concertina-fold under the line of the joint placed on the vapour barrier membrane where the
edges of the mesh are turned up a minimum of 25 mm to be cast into the slab and a strip of
the vapour barrier membrane or similar material laid on the mesh to prevent the concrete
slurry from bonding the concertina-fold (see Figure 5.4).
The sheet so placed shall extend for the full length of the joint and interconnect with
adjacent termite management system components.

5.3.8 External walls
5.3.8.1 General
Sheeting applied to external walls shall extend through the wall and be continuously visible
at the exterior.
Where ﬂexible sheeting is installed with a fold at the corners, it shall be placed so that no
fold opens to the wall interior.
NOTES:
1 For typical examples, see Figures 5.5 and 5.9.
2 A fold that opens into a cavity or internal space may permit partially concealed access and
hence, such folds should open to the Visible perimeter.
5.3.8.2 External walls in conjunction with concrete ﬂoor slab
Sheet material shall extend from the concrete slab to the exterior surface of the wall. At the
face of the concrete, any part of the sheet that is not fully and permanently compressed
beneath the bottom plate or other building components, such that no gap exceeds 0.4 mm,
shall extend a minimum of 35 mm and be triple-rolled, brazed, welded or jointed using a
termite-resistant ﬁller or termite-resistant adhesive.
For an inﬁll slab poured against masonry, the sheet material shall extend a minimum of
35 mm from exterior face or beyond any exposed upper edge of inﬁll (knockout) block
[see Figure 5.5(c)].

5.3.11 Joints
A11 joints in sheeting shall be termite resistant. Metal sheet joints that are not fully and
permanently compressed between other building components shall be triple-rolled for a
minimum of 10 mm, brazed welded or jointed using a termite—resistant ﬁller or
termite-resistant adhesive.
NOTE: For triple roll folded joint, see Figure 5.8.
Joints in chemically treated sheet shall be overlapped by a minimum of 50 mm. Joints that
are not fully and permanently compressed between other building components shall be
jointed using a compatible termite-resistant filler or termite-resistant adhesive. Any
fasteners, rivets, clips, tape or other restraints applied to a sheet shall be compatible with
that sheet and shall be assessed in accordance with AS 3660.3 as not reducing the design
life.
Full and permanent compression of sheet joints may be achieved by a mass of masonry or
blockwork such that there is no measurable gap between overlapped sheets. Sheet material
draped across the cavity of masonry wall (if one exists) is not in a compressed state.

SECTION 6 REQUIREMENTS—GRANULAR
MATERIALS

6.1 GENERAL
This Section sets out requirements for granular materials used as a component of a termite
management system to deter termites from gaining concealed access to a building.
This Section shall be read in conjunction with the design criteria of Section 3.

6.2 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS
6.2.1 Granules
Granular material used as a termite management system shall comprise a termite-resistant
material tested in accordance with AS 3660.3. Where a granular material is compacted it
shall replicate the compaction to which it was tested.
NOTES:
1 Granular materials should be stored and handled in such a way that contamination by soil or
organic materials is prevented.
2 Seals or capping systems should be continuous, and able to withstand exposure and any likely
physical disturbance while remaining in contact with the granular material beneath. The seal
or capping system should be such that it does not itself form a hidden access path for
termites. Capping for granular materials at construction/control joints and at slab penetrations
should protect against removal or contamination.
3 Capping systems may consist of concrete, bituminous material, acrylics or other plastics.
6.2.2 Interface with sheet materials
Sheet materials used in conjunction with granular materials shall comply with Item (f), (g)
or (h) of Clause 5.2 or Clause 3.2(f). At their interface, sheet materials and granular
materials shall be placed in direct contact with an overlap or penetration.

6.3 INSTALLATION
6.3.1 General
Granular materials may be used in conjunction with other termite management systems to
provide an integrated termite management system.
Where used against concealed termite entry, mineral granular materials shall be placed in
those areas to a minimum depth of 75 mm, and impregnated granular materials to a
minimum depth of 40 mm. Granular materials shall be retained so as to remain in contact
with the internal surfaces of the adjoining material (e. 

g. masonry).

NOTES:
1 Granular materials maintain some ﬂuidity after placement such that settling of uncompacted
granules is common.
2 Uncompacted granules require a greater depth to achieve equivalence to compacted granules.

AS 3660.1:2014 38

6.3.2 External walls
Where granular materials are used internally at the perimeter of a building, the granular
materials shall be placed in wall cavities to a minimum width of 40 mm for mineral
granules and 25 mm for impregnated granules with a minimum compacted depth of 75 mm
above the adjoining ﬁnished ground, landscaping or paving level. The cavity shall be clear
of rubble and waste. Sheet material in accordance with Clause 6.2.2 shall be incorporated
into the masonry as illustrated in Figures 6.1 with a minimum vertical penetration of 35 mm
and a maximum vertical penetration of 50 mm into the granules. Such sheet shall pass fully
beneath, or penetrate into, the granular materials. The sheet material shall extend through
the wall with the external edge being visible where it deﬁnes the inspection zone. Where
the external wall is rendered masonry, the sheet material shall be ﬁnished flush with the
outside face of the render. Alternatively, if there is to be a control joint in the render at the
course in which the sheet is installed, the sheet shall ﬁnish ﬂush with the masonry.
Where the vertical face of a concrete slab or footing is honeycombed or rippled as a result
of folds in the vapour barrier or irregular formwork, the surface shall be ﬂattened so that
complete contact between the granules and concrete can be achieved. Contact shall be
achieved by compacting the granular materials in situ.
Where the granular materials are to be deeper than 150 mm, they shall be tamped in
successive layers of not more than 100 mm.

6.3.3 Penetrations
Each service pipe or similar concrete slab penetration shall pass through a circular void that
surrounds the penetration with a regular minimum clearance of 25 mm. The void shall then
be ﬁlled with granular materials to a minimum compacted depth of 75 mm for mineral
granular materials, or 40 mm for impregnated granular materials. It shall be retained from
beneath the slab with a retaining ﬂange made from unplasticized PVC complying with
Clause 3.2(f), or a similar durable, corrosion- and termite-resistant material cast into the
underside of the slab. The top of the graded granular collar shall be capped to prevent
granule loss or contamination.
NOTE: For typical details, see Figure 6.2.
Where granular materials are used around slab penetrations, the void shall be clear of
rubble and waste, and the granular materials shall be placed in contact with the bottom and
sides of the void. Contact shall be achieved by compacting the granular materials in situ.
Where the granular materials are to be deeper than 150 mm, they shall be compacted in
successive layers of not more than 100 mm.
Granular materials are not commonly employed around pipe penetrations except where,
post-pour, a penetrating pipe or conduit is required to be moved. In such installations, the
edges of the cut or broken concrete shall be ﬂattened so that complete contact between the
granular materials and concrete can be achieved. Where saw cuts are used, they shall be
opened to permit contact with the granular material or shall be ﬁlled with a non-shrinking
grout.

6.3.4 Joints
Where controlled concrete cracking or movement is expected, all slab joints and points
shall be either underlain by an under-ﬂoor installation (see Clause 6.3.5) or treated with a
granular material ﬁlled void adjoining the joint. The void shall be ﬁlled with granular
material to a minimum compacted depth of 75 mm and a minimum width of 50 mm for
mineral granular material, or a minimum compacted depth of 40 mm and a minimum Width
of 25 mm for impregnated granular material. The top, bottom and ends of the resultant
granular material shall be capped (see Clause 6.2.1) to retain integrity and to prevent egress
of the granules. The joint below the granules shall be sealed with a joint sealant with an
elastic recovery. The material shall not delaminate from either side of the construction or
control joint.
NOTE: For typical detail of granular materials at joints, see Figure 6.3.
The termite management system formed by this process shall extend for the full length of
the joint and interface effectively with the termite management system at the building
perimeter.
The cavity shall be clear of rubble and waste, and the granular materials shall be placed in
contact with the sides of the void. Contact shall be achieved by tamping the granular
materials in situ.

SECTION 7 REQUIREMENTS—CHEMICAL
TERMITE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

7.1 GENERAL
This Section sets out requirements for chemicals to be used as a component of a termite
management system to deter termites from gaining concealed access to a building.
This Section shall be read in conjunction with the requirements of Section 3.
7.1.1 Soil chemical
A soil chemical component system shall comply with AS 3660.3. The chemical used shall
be registered by the pesticides registrar.
Chemical termite management systems applied under concealed and inaccessible areas shall
be replenishable via a reticulation system providing an even and continuous distribution of
chemical into the soil.
NOTES:
1 Consideration should be given as to how the chemical will be reapplied.
2 The chemical treatments speciﬁed in this Section are not applicable for use against
wood-boring beetles, fungi or termites other than subterranean species.
3 A chemical soil termite management system is most readily installed while a building is under
construction. Application of the chemical has to be at a stage of construction when the whole
of the subﬂoor area is readily accessible. In most cases, however, work is progressive, and
special care should be taken to ensure that the system is complete and that each stage is well
integrated so that no avenues of entry are left open to the termites.

7.2 CHEMICAL REQUIREMENTS
All chemical products shall be registered by the pesticides registrar and tested in
accordance with AS 3660.3. Chemical products shall be applied in accordance with the
pesticides registrar’s approved label.

7.3 RESTRICTIONS ON AREAS OF APPLICATION
The following restrictions apply to the installation of chemical termite management
systems:
(a) Drains Chemical mixtures shall not be applied directly, or in close proximity to,
rubble and agricultural pipe drains, to prevent chemicals entering the drain.
NOTE: Installing termite management systems may require the removal and reinstatement of
drains, and/or the use of physical termite management systems to prevent chemicals from
entering the drain.
(b) Impervious surfaces Surfaces such as concrete, timber, rocks, stones, masonry or
similar materials shall not receive direct applications of chemical. Treatment shall be
limited to cracks, faults or joints and to the soil in contact with their perimeter.
NOTE: Alternative measures may be necessary to provide a complete termite management
system.
(c) In wall cavities Chemical products described in this Section shall not be used as a
surface treatment in wall cavities.
((1) Concrete perimeter At a concrete perimeter, chemical products shall be applied so
as to maintain direct contact with concrete slabs.
NOTE: Only where a vapour barrier or damp-proof membrane is not required by the NCC can
a chemical concrete perimeter system be used.

Accessed by Ventura Homes on 03 Apr 2017 (Document currency not guaranteed when printed)

AS 3660.1:2014 46

7.4 SOIL PREPARATION
To allow the required distribution of the applied chemical and to permit percolation into the
soil, the soil shall be prepared as follows:
(a) Removal of contaminants All timber offcuts, building debris, removable formwork
and other waste materials shall be removed from the area to be treated.
(b) Clay soils, sloping sites On clay soils, the surface of the soil shall be scariﬁed along
the contours to form furrows to a depth of not less than 50 mm to 80 mm, or a 50 mm
minimum layer of ﬁne soil shall be used to retain the applied chemical.
NOTE: All clumps of clay should be broken up or removed from the area. Some ﬁne soil
should be introduced and mixed with the broken-up clay soil.
(c) Sandy or porous soils Where loose, sandy or porous soils are dry, they shall be
moistened with water immediately before chemical treatment to prevent loss of
chemical through ‘piping’ or excessive percolation.
NOTE: On clay soils, penetration is likely to be slow, and on sloping sites runoff of the
chemical mixture is likely to occur. If the soil cannot retain a chemical, consideration should
be given to replacing the soil.

7.5 METHOD OF APPLICATION AND INSTALLATION
7.5.1 General
Chemical mixtures shall be applied to the soil by hand-spray or reticulation systems and in
accordance with the rates and manner speciﬁed by the pesticides registrar and shall be
tested in accordance with AS 3660.3.
When applied by hand-spray, only low-pressure, high-volume spray equipment that delivers
coarse droplets shall be used.
7.5.2 Horizontal application
Horizontal application shall be used to deter termites from gaining concealed vertical access
to the substructure of the building. The area of treated soil shall—
(a) be a minimum of 150 mm wide to a minimum depth of 50 mm, unless otherwise
speciﬁed on the product label;
(b) abut the substructure walls on both sides;
(c) surround all other connections between the building and the soil;
((1) cover all areas of subﬂoor soil where there is inadequate access (see Clause 3.3.2) or
where there is less than 400 mm clearance; and
(e) be continuous beneath a concrete slab-on-ground or slab-on-ﬁll.
7.5.3 Vertical application
Vertical application shall be used to deter termites from gaining concealed horizontal access
to the building. The area of treated soil shall—
(a) be at least 150 mm wide, installed to a depth 50 mm below the top of footing;
(b) abut the substructure or substructure wall and footing;
(c) surround all connections between the building and the soil which provide concealed
access to the building, e.g. pipes and conduits;
(d) adjoin horizontal termite management systems; and

47 AS 3660.1:2014

(e) continuously surround all portions of stumps or piers that are in the ground.
NOTES:
1 Vertical chemical application may be installed by excavating trenches, treating the exposed
trench, backﬁlling and treating the backﬁll.
2 The characteristics of the site and the construction determine the most suitable method of
application.
3 For chemical under slab and perimeter application, see Figure 7.2.
7.5.4 External perimeter application
An external perimeter chemical soil application shall be a minimum of 150 mm wide X a
minimum of 80 mm deep and extend not less than 50 mm below the lowest point where the
construction below ground could allow concealed termite ingress (see Figures 7.8 and 7.9).
7.5.5 Reticulation systems
Where a reticulation system is installed, the maximum pressure to be applied in
replenishing the system speciﬁed by the reticulation system manufacturer shall be displayed
on the Certiﬁcate of Installation, along with the volumes of termiticides required at each ﬁll
point.

7.6 STAGES OF APPLICATION
Treatment of particular areas shall be made after the site has been prepared in accordance
with Clause 7.4, and at the following stages:
(a) Where hand-spray treatments are permitted, the following shall apply:
(i) For buildings with a suspended ﬂoor, immediately before laying the ﬂoor.
(ii) For buildings with a slab-on-ground ﬂoor, immediately (on the same day)
before the vapour barrier or damp proof membrane is placed.
(iii) For external treatments, on completion of the construction when all formwork
has been removed, services have been connected and backﬁll is in place,
treatment shall not be performed just before or after heavy rain, unless the
treatment can be physically protected.
NOTE: Rain may cause leaching and runoff before the chemical has bound to the soil.
(b) Where reticulation systems are installed and the chemical is approved for use through
a reticulation system on the manufacturer’s product label and in accordance with
testing under AS 3660.3, the initial under-slab treatment shall be applied as soon as
practicable after a 28 d period following the placing of the slab.
NOTE: The manufacturer’s product label is the label as registered by the pesticides registrar.

7.7 AREAS OF APPLICATION
7.7.1 General
An acceptable chemical soil termite management system for the entire perimeter and
subﬂoor, as specified in Clause 7.5, shall be deemed to have been achieved if the chemical
is as deﬁned in Clause 1.4.1.3
NOTES:
1 For typical details for perimeter and under-slab applications, see Figures 7.1 and 7.2.
2 For typical details for masonry blockwork, see Figure 7.3.
3 For typical details for changes in ﬂoor levels, see Figure 7.4.

APPENDIX A
GUIDANCE ON INSTALLATION OF TERMITE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
(Informative)

A1 INTERFACE BETWEEN NEW AND EXISTING WORK
Building owners should be aware that this Standard may not provide adequate solutions for
ground-ﬂoor level extensions or renovation that are connected to an existing building,
irrespective of whether the existing building has been previously constructed in accordance
with this Standard or its predecessors, or may not have had such provisions made. For
termite management of an existing building, refer to AS 3660.2.
During the design and construction process, it is recommended that consultation occurs
between the various parties, which may include the designer, the builders, the termite
specialist and the owner. This will ensure that termite management systems are properly
designed and installed.
Where a termite management system cannot be provided in accordance with this Standard,
the limitations of the system, as installed, should be documented and supplied to the
building owner along with a recommendation for more frequent inspections.

A2 CONSTRUCTION AT OR NEAR BOUNDARY
Where construction at or near the boundary is carried out, it may not be possible to install a
complete management system as speciﬁed in this Standard. These situations may include
duplexes, villas, townhouses, parapet walls, buildings with zero setbacks to an allotment
boundary on separate title allotments, and the like.
Where a termite management system cannot be provided on a boundary, access for
inspection may not be available.
Building owners should be aware that construction at or near a boundary could result in a
greater risk of termite entry due to one or a combination of the following factors:
(a) Concealed entry to the structure because of the specific construction methods used.
(b) Lack of access for the installation of a termite management system during
construction.
(c) Lack of access for inspection and maintenance.
((1) The actions of adjoining owners, which may compromise the effectiveness of the
termite management after construction.

A3 CERTIFICATES OF INSTALLATION
The installers of a termite management system in accordance with this Standard should
provide the person soliciting the work with copies of all the ‘Certiﬁcates of Installation’ in
accordance with AS 3660.1 (this Standard) that apply to the work.

APPENDIX C
NATURALLY TERMITE-RESISTANT TIMBERS
(Normative)

C1 SCOPE
This Appendix lists timbers that have a demonstrated natural resistance to subterranean
termites in Australia.
NOTE: The list is by no means complete and is subject to change, particularly when the resource
varies, e.g. the production from a young fast growth plantation compared with an old growth,
higher density resource.

C2 GENERAL
For all timbers listed in this Appendix, only the heartwood is resistant to attack by termites.
Untreated sapwood shall be deemed to be susceptible to attack. Inner heartwood
(nearer the pith) is considered less resistant to attack than the outer heartwood.
NOTE: Many timbers can vary in resistance to termite attack from tree to tree as well as Within
the same tree. In addition, the termite resistance of timber exposed above the ground may be
superior to its resistance in the ground.

C3 TERMITE RESISTANCE
Only the timber species listed under botanical names in Paragraph C5 shall be deemed to be
naturally termite resistant (see Note 1).
NOTES:
1 The common names listed in Paragraph C5 may cover one or more timber species. Species
that are not speciﬁcally listed under botanical names are not covered by this Standard.
2 Resistance to termites has been determined from in-ground durability tests on timber
specimens cut from old growth trees in the presence of wood-rotting fungi. Where data from
such tests is not available, termite resistance is based on recognized durability ratings
obtained from many years of experience with the particular timber in service. Natural termite
resistance of timbers is covered in AS 5604.
3 Different timber species have different levels of resistance to various species of termite.
Local experience should be referred to.
4 For information on the termite resistance of imported timbers not listed in this Appendix,
refer to Keating and Bolza (see Bibliography).

C4 AVAILABILITY
Many of the timbers listed are not commercially available but are included for those who
have access to private supplies for minor constructions, e.g. fences and landscaping.

APPENDIX E
SOIL-SAMPLING PROTOCOL FOR TESTING HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL
CHEMICAL SOIL TERMITE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
(Normative)

E1 GENERAL
Where testing to determine the compliance of horizontal and vertical chemical soil termite
management systems with label directions is to be undertaken, the protocol specified in this
Appendix shall be used.
For the purposes of this protocol, soil shall include sand and clay.
NOTE: This protocol only provides the methodology for assessing whether a particular site has
received the total amount of termiticide required to be applied to an area. It is intended for use
within ﬁve days of application. It assumes an application has been made to the entire area
requiring treatment.

E2 SAMPLING PROCEDURE
E2.1 Sampling tool
A coring tool consisting of a metal pipe With an internal diameter of approximately 30 mm
shall be used to collect soil samples. For sampling horizontal applications, a ﬂange, welded
75 mm from the penetrating end of the tool, shall be used to maintain a uniform depth of
penetration.
E2.2 Sampling method
The rate of application of termiticide in horizontal and vertical chemical application shall
be determined by taking composite samples, as follows:
(a) Horizontal application:
(i) Under slab Following application of chemical, divide the treated area into a
conceptual grid of non-overlapping 2 m X l m cells. Number cells from one to
the maximum number of units at the site. Allocate an additional cell number to
cells that lie along the slab perimeter and those that include penetrations.
Use a table of non-repeating random numbers to generate a sample of
15 different cells (i.e. no repetition) to be used as sampling units. Make up
composite samples from cores taken from each of these units. Cores shall be
taken perpendicularly from the horizontal surface of the selected sampling units
to a depth of 75 mm.
Sites shall not be sampled until the chemical has completely penetrated the
bedding material and no pools remain on the surface. Two composite samples
(A and B) shall be taken from each site.
After taking samples, ensure that the integrity of the chemical and vapour
barrier (if present) is restored.
NOTE: For post-construction under-slab sampling, slab drilling will be necessary
before sampling takes place. Most of the termiticide residue is to be found in the upper
1—2 cm of the bedding material. Therefore, it is important to avoid dislodging any of
this material when removing or drilling the slab.

65 AS 3660.1:2014

(ii) Perimeter Take two samples from each designated treatment site (e.g. the slab
perimeter, the inner foundation wall, the outer foundation wall and the
foundation pier). Each sample shall be a composite of eight individual cores,
obtained at the rate of two cores per side of the structure for the slab perimeter,
the inner foundation wall and the outer foundation wall samples (with the
understanding that there will be four general sides of each structure).
For the foundation pier samples, take one core from each side of two piers to
obtain the required eight cores.
Cores shall be taken perpendicularly from the surface to a depth of 75 mm and
at not more than 75 mm from the adjacent construction element.
Samples shall not be taken in areas where prejudicial conditions exist
(e.g. below taps).
Two composite samples (A and B) shall be taken from each site.
After taking samples, ensure that the integrity of the chemical and vapour
barrier (if present) is restored.
(b) Vertical application Take two samples from each designated treatment site (e.g. the
slab perimeter, the inner foundation wall, the outer foundation wall and the
foundation pier). Each sample shall be a composite of 8 individual cores, obtained at
the rate of two cores per side of the structure, for the slab perimeter, the inner
foundation wall and the outer foundation wall samples (with the understanding that
there will be four general sides of each structure).
For the foundation pier samples, take one core from each side of two piers to obtain
the required 8 cores.
Cores shall be taken perpendicularly from the surface to a depth of 75 mm. Cores
shall not exceed the depth of the treated soil, that is, where samples are taken, the
chemical shall be a minimum of 75 mm deep. Cores shall be taken at not more than
75 mm from the adjacent construction element.
Samples shall not be taken in areas where prejudicial conditions exist (e.g. below
taps).
Two composite samples (A and B) shall be taken from each site.
After taking samples ensure that the integrity of the chemical is restored.
E2.3 Handling the sample
Once collected, samples shall be placed into either aluminium-foil-lined paper bags or glass
jars (sealed with aluminium foil-lined lids), identiﬁable by a label with details of the site
(name of the chemical if known, and date applied, the address of the location sampled, and
the date the sample was taken) and stored immediately in a cool, concealed environment
(i.e. cooler with ice) away from direct sunlight. Samples shall be delivered to an analytical
laboratory within 48 h of being collected and stored before analysis at either 4°C for a
maximum of 14 days, or at —20°C for a maximum of 6 weeks from the time they were
taken. If the above storage conditions cannot be met, sample stability data under the chosen
conditions shall be provided.
The chain of custody shall be recorded for all samples. A document signed by all persons
responsible for the integrity of the samples shall accompany the sample to the laboratory.
When the sample arrives at the laboratory, this document shall also be signed by laboratory
personnel. It shall be maintained as part of the investigation file.

E3 ANALYSIS
E3.1 Determination of chemical concentration
A validated testing method employed by a registered testing authority, certified for analysis
of the particular chemical in soil and sand, shall be used. Alternatively, if a registered
testing authority is not used, validation data (recovery, precision and limit of quantitation)
for the analytical method shall be provided for the chemical in soil equivalent to that being
sampled.
E3.2 Calculations
The following calculations shall be used to determine the grams of chemical residue per
unit surface area (i.e. grams per metre squared) for horizontal applications or per unit
volume (i.e. grams per metre cubed) for vertical applications (these calculations also adjust
for the total mass of the sample):
(a) Horizontal application:

where

Ra = mass of chemical residue per unit surface area, in grams per metre
squared (g/mz)
Rv = mass of chemical residue per unit volume, in grams per metre cubed
(g/m3)
Rc = concentration of the chemical residue in soil, in milligrams per
kilogram (mg/kg)
mw = total moist weight of sample, or average total moist weight where
combined samples are tested (see Paragraph E3.3), in kilograms (kg)
C = number of cores taken (normally 15)
r = internal radius of the coring tool, in millimetres (mm); (normally
15 mm)
h = depth of core taken for a vertical application, in millimetres (mm);
(normally 75 mm)
E3.3 Strategy
For each site, sample A shall be tested and if the mass of chemical exceeds the lowest
expected threshold value (LETV) shown in Table E1, the site shall be deemed to have
passed. Otherwise, a quarter of sample B shall be pooled with a quarter of sample A and the
composite shall be tested. The site shall be deemed to have failed if the mass of chemical is
less than the LETV.
E3.4 Sample remnants
Sample remnants shall be stored under appropriate conditions as specified in
Paragraph E2.4, for a period of at least one month and made available for independent
analysis if requested.

BUILDING SITE MANAGEMENT
(Normative)

To reduce the risk of subterranean termite infestation during and immediately following
construction, the following precautions shall be taken:
(a)

(b)

(C)

© Standards Australia

Any nest of economically important wood-feeding species of subterranean termites
(see Note 1) found within the property boundaries, up to a distance of 50 m from the
proposed new building work, shall have the colony eliminated prior to
commencement of construction works.
NOTES:
1 Options for colony elimination are given in AS 3660.2.
2 For a list of economically important wood-feeding species of subterranean termites, see
Appendix B.
3 Subterranean termite nests are generally concealed and usually difﬁcult or impracticable
to locate. It is not unusual for several nests to be present in the grounds of a property. Due
to their concealment and the small size of some colonies, it is often neither practicable
nor possible to locate and destroy all the nests.
All tree stumps and logs shall be excavated and removed from the building footprint.
Tree roots that have been exposed within the excavation shall be removed from the
building footprint.
All timber offcuts, building debris, removable formwork and other waste materials
shall be removed from the area to be treated.
